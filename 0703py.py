# leetcode 0703 - Kth Largest Element in a Stream
# Easy
#
# Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream.
# Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
#
# Implement KthLargest class:
#     KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
#     int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream
#     and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.
# Time: O(mlogn)? Memory: O(1)
class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        # minHeap with K largest integers
        self.minHeap = nums
        self.k = k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]

# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
