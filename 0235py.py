# leetcode 011 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
#
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
# â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T
# that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        current = root

        while current:
            if p.val > current.val and q.val > current.val:
                current = current.right
            elif p.val < current.val and q.val < current.val:
                current = current.left
            else:
                return current
