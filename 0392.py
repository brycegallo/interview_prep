# leetcode 0392 - Is Subsequence
# Easy
#
# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
#
# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none)
# of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
# (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
# Time: O(n) / O(t) Memory: O(1)
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return True if i == len(s) else False
