# leetcode 0973 - K Closest Points to Origin
# Medium
#
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
# return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
#
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
# Time: O(nlogn)? Memory: O(n)?
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        minHeap, result = [], []

        for x, y in points:
            distance = x ** 2 + y ** 2
            minHeap.append([distance, x, y])
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        while k > 0:
            distance, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            result.append([x, y])
            k -= 1
        return result
